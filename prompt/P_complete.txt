We define the structure of the VTP description for triggering the vulnerabilities, which
is a graph with operations and transitions:

* The definition of operations and transitions in the VTP description.

Please note that each Vul_Type has a CWE type and error type. Different CWE and
error types have different Focus (f) on extracting VTP description.
* The definition of CWE and error types.
* Focus List: <Vul_Type_1,f_1>,...,<Vul_Type_n,f_n>

The input VTP description is {JSON-formatted VTP Description}.
Please determine whether this VTP description is complete based on the previous definition.
If the VTP description is not complete, you can generate the missing nodes and edges based on the Focus List.
The inputted IR is {Title, Body}. After you generate the complete VTP description, you can update the content of IR.
