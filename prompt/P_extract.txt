We define the structure of the VTP description for triggering the vulnerabilities, which
is a graph with operations and transitions:

* The definition of operations and transitions in the VTP description.

Please note that each Vul_Type has a CWE type and error type. Different CWE and
error types have different Focus (f) on extracting VTP description.
* The definition of CWE and error types.
* Focus List: <Vul_Type_1,f_1>,...,<Vul_Type_n,f_n>

The input IR is {Title, Body}, where Title is the summarization of vulnerability, and
Body incorporates the content of the vulnerability. Please generate the VTP description
based on the previous definition.
